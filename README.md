# About
As it turns out, I learn programming best by building projects that pop into my head. This CLI version of Tetris proved to be the kind of project that, surprisingly, LLMs couldn't help me solve. For example, the AI models struggled with collision detection—and so did I—so I ended up writing the whole thing myself using my neurons and Rust documentation.
