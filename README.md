# About
As it turns out, I learn programming best by building projects that pop into my head. This CLI version of Tetris proved to be the kind of project that, surprisingly, LLMs couldn't help me with that much. For example, the AI models struggled with collision detection — and so did I — so I ended up writing almost the whole thing myself using my neurons and Rust documentation. Last but not least, I also did it just because I want to play Tetris freely, without advertisements. Now you can do the same!

Please report any bug!
